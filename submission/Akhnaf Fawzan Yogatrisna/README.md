# Proof of Existence Project - Special Topics for Information Engineering

## Description
This project is a simple blockchain-based proof-of-existence system built using Solidity and deployed on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet. The contract allows users to record (notarize) the hash of any document on the blockchain, proving that it existed at a specific time without revealing the actual content of the document. Each notarized document is permanently stored with its timestamp. Users can also verify later whether a particular document has been notarized by checking its hash. This ensures authenticity and integrity of files in a decentralized way, making it more transparent.

## Tools Used
- **Remix IDE:**
Used to write, compile, and deploy the Solidity smart contract.

- **Metamask:**
A crypto wallet used to conenct to the Ethereum test network. It handles transaction signing and gas fees required for deployment and interaction with the smart contract.

- **Sepolia Faucet:**
Mining site for free SepoliaETH for gas fees, which can be send to wallet address.
