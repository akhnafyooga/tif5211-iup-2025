This project really gave me insight on the practical aspects of blockchain, especially how to deploy smart contracts using Solidity and Ethereum Sepolia test network, which is something that i am not too familiar with. 

Writing the ProofOfExistence.sol contract helped me gain an understanding of how Solidity structures variable, functions, events, and how they interact. The process of deploying it to the Sepolia testnet gave me an understanding of transparecy and decentralization of blockchain, since every transaction is permanently saved and recorded, and also verifiable in public.

In this project, i learned how to manage wallet addresses, make transactions, and handle gas fees in MetaMask, especially SepoliaETH network. I also learn how to deploy and notarized smart contract using Remix IDE.

One of the challenges i faced in this project was keeping my text hash to verify the document. I wrote it but once lost it and i had to search it in my notepad. This issue taught me to save my keys in blockchain carefully. Being unfamiliar with Remix IDE UI at first, i had to learn the function of the tab one-by-one, which i greatly appreciate for my future endeavors. Overall, this project was an astounding experience that improve my skill and understanding in blockchain.
